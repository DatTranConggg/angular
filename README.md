# LearnAngular

- Dependency Injection (DI) is a core design pattern in the Angular framework that helps manage the dependencies between different parts of your application. It's a technique for providing instances of classes (services or other objects) that a class (component, service, etc.) depends on, rather than the class creating those instances itself. This promotes modular, reusable, and maintainable code by reducing tight coupling between components and making your application more flexible and easier to test.
